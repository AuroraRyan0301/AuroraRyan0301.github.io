# About Me
<img src="/images/Ryan.jpg" class="floatpic" width="600" height="720">
Here is **Ruihan Yu ([Ryan](https://github.com/AuroraRyan0301/AuroraRyan0301.github.io/blob/main/file/余睿涵简历.pdf))**.
I am a master's student in the Physics Department at Tsinghua University, currently pursuing research in two different areas simultaneously. Under the supervision of Professor Xu Feng, I am involved in the field of computer vision, specifically focusing on 3D reconstruction and physics-based rendering. Additionally, under the guidance of Professor Ding Shiqian, I am conducting research on atomic nucleus optical clocks and four-wave mixing in the field of physics.

With the agreement and support of both supervisors, I have successfully managed to balance and excel in both research areas due to their distinct nature and work content. Looking ahead, my future plan is to pursue a Ph.D. in the field of 3D Vision. 

Here is [my Resume](https://github.com/AuroraRyan/AuroraRyan0301.github.io/blob/main/file/Resume-RyanYu.pdf).
