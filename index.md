# About Me
<img src="/images/Ryan.jpg" class="floatpic" width="600" height="720">

Here is **Ruihan Yu ([Ryan](/file/CV_Yu_Ruihan_en.pdf))**.
I am a master's student in the Physics Department at Tsinghua University, currently pursuing research in two different areas simultaneously. 

Under the supervision of Professor Xu Feng, I am involved in the field of physics-based rendering and 3D computer vision, specifically focusing on physics-based differentiable rendering and 3D reconstruction.

Additionally, under the guidance of Professor Ding Shiqian, I am conducting research on atomic nucleus optical clocks and four-wave mixing in the field of physics.

Looking ahead, my future plan is to pursue a Ph.D. in the field of rendering or 3D Vision. 

Here is [my Resume](/file/CV_Yu_Ruihan_en.pdf).
